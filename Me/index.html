		<p>Before joining the Startup Institute, I was on-track for a life as a Government employee. My degree in International Affairs and minor in Political Science and History led me to study abroad in Turkey, intern for the British Parliament in London, and work for the State Department in Madrid. Perhaps it was my love of constant learning that led me to ditch my "set path" at my Government desk job to join the Web Design program at the Startup Institute.</p> 

		<p>My non-tech background, as well as the hard skills from SIâ€™s web design program makes me a dynamic, flexible, and collaborative team member; one that is sure to fill multiple roles and achieve business goals with success.</p>
